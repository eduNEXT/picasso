Welcome to Picasso's documentation!
###################################

Picasso is a tool designed to help teams simplify the build process for the Open edX Docker images, tailored explicitly for use in Tutor environments. It enables the addition of custom behaviors and features through the internal plugin `tutor-contrib-picasso`_, allowing for additional flexibility during the build process.

Here you will find information on how to configure Picasso, how to reuse the workflow, and some performance considerations to keep in mind. If you encounter any issues, you can also check the troubleshooting section for some common problems and solutions.
