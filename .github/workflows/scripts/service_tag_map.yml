# This YAML file defines the mapping between service names and the corresponding
# keys in the Tutor configuration (`config.yml`) where each serviceâ€™s image name
# or tag is stored.
#
# It is used by automation scripts (such as those for dynamic tag generation)
# to identify the exact key in `config.yml` that should be updated for a given service.
#
# Structure:
#   <service_name>: <config_key_in_config_yml>
#
# Where:
# - `service_name` is the logical name of the microservice (e.g., "openedx", "ecommerce", "forum")
# - `config_key_in_config_yml` is the key under which the Docker image name/tag is stored in `config.yml`
#
#
# This allows scripts to remain generic and dynamically locate the correct field to update
# based on which service is being processed.
