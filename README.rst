Picasso Workflow
################

Simplifies the build of Open edX Docker images for Tutor environments, providing a solution that integrates directly with GitHub Actions.

Purpose
*******

Picasso is a tool designed to help teams simplify the build process for the Open edX Docker images, tailored explicitly for use in Tutor environments. It enables the addition of custom behaviors and features through the internal plugin `tutor-contrib-picasso`_, allowing for additional flexibility during the build process.

This workflow integrates seamlessly with existing internal workflows, enabling it to be invoked in custom jobs. It leverages Tutor to build images starting from the **Olive** version, which can be deployed across both production and development environments. This ensures consistency in managing multiple environments while simplifying the overall process.

With Picasso, teams can build custom Open edX images with additional functionality, making it easier to maintain, extend, and deploy environments using modern CI/CD practices.

Workflow Overview
*****************

The Picasso Workflow is designed to build Open edX Docker images for Tutor environments.

Key features of the Picasso Workflow include:

- **Runs on GitHub-hosted runners**: By default, the workflow uses ``ubuntu-latest`` runners to execute jobs. This can't be changed to self-hosted runners for the time being.
- **Builds and pushes Docker images**: The workflow pushes images to Dockerhub by default. This can be customized to push images to other registries.
- **Supports multiple services**: You can specify the service to build (e.g., ``openedx``, ``mfe``, ``codejail``, etc.) using the ``SERVICE`` input.
- **Customizable repository and strain**: The workflow allows for specifying the repository, branch, and path to the strain being built. This enables building images from different configurations.
- **Configurable BuildKit parallelism**: By default, the workflow limits parallelism during the build process to optimize resource usage, although this can be changed using the ``ENABLE_LIMIT_BUILDKIT_PARALLELISM`` input. This is useful for low-powered machines, like `Github Actions standard runners`_.
- **Private repository access**: SSH keys are used to clone private repositories securely. The SSH private key should be stored as a secret in the repository, and must have access to the repository specified in ``STRAIN_REPOSITORY``.
- **Extra commands**: The workflow allows running additional custom commands with ``tutor picasso run-extra-commands``. For details, refer to the `tutor-contrib-picasso`_ documentation.
- **Environment setup**: The workflow sets up installs necessary plugins like ``tutor-contrib-picasso``, and prepares the environment to build and push Docker images using the `Tutor CLI`_.

Usage
*****

To use the Picasso Workflow, follow these steps:

1. Ensure your repository calls the Picasso workflow like the one below. This example demonstrates how to build an Open edX image using the Picasso workflow:

   .. code-block:: yaml

      jobs:
        build:
          name: Build Open edX Image
          uses: eduNEXT/picasso/.github/workflows/build.yml@main
          with:
            STRAIN_REPOSITORY: edunext/builds
            STRAIN_REPOSITORY_BRANCH: main
            STRAIN_PATH: redwood/base
            SERVICE: openedx
          secrets:
            DOCKERHUB_USERNAME: ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_USERNAME }}
            DOCKERHUB_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_PASSWORD }}
            SSH_PRIVATE_KEY: ${{ secrets.SSH_PRIVATE_KEY }}

2. Modify the ``STRAIN_REPOSITORY``, ``STRAIN_REPOSITORY_BRANCH``, ``STRAIN_PATH``, and ``SERVICE`` inputs to match your project requirements.

3. You can also set up a custom trigger for the workflow based on your project requirements.
